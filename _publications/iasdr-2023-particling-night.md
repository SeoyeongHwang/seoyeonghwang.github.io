This study explores the potential of interactive media art to promote reflection on ourselves living insocial networks. The prevalence of social media platforms has increased our social connections, yetresearch suggests a rise in loneliness and isolation. We created an interactive media artwork usingspeech-to-text technology and generative visualization to reflect on the meaning of relationships in theage of digitized human connections as well as the superficiality of social media networks we developed.User surveys and observations revealed that our artwork helped our audience to have reflectionthrough artistic experiences. The findings suggest that multi-modal art experiences and embodieddesign components can provide better opportunities for one’s reflection process. This study cancontribute to the design and evaluation of future emerging media artworks that can support individuals’reflection process on various humane issues caused by emerging technology.
