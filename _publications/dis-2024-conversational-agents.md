This paper investigates the potential of LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) to enhance critical reflection and mitigate design fixation in group design work. By challenging AI-generated recommendations and prevailing group opinions, these agents address issues such as groupthink and promote a more dynamic and inclusive design process. Key design considerations include optimizing intervention timing, ensuring clarity in counterarguments, and balancing critical thinking with designers' satisfaction. CAs can also adapt to various roles, supporting individual and collective reflection. Our work aligns with the "Death of the Design Researcher?" workshop's goals, emphasizing the transformative potential of generative AI in reshaping design practices and promoting ethical considerations. By exploring innovative uses of generative AI in group design contexts, we aim to stimulate discussion and open new pathways for future research and development, ultimately contributing to practical tools and resources for design researchers.
