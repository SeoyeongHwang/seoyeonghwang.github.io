Group dance, a sub-genre characterized by intricate motions made by a cohort of performers in tight synchronization, has a longstanding and culturally significant history and, in modern forms such as cheerleading, a broad base of current adherents. However, despite its popularity, learning group dance routines remains challenging. Based on the prior success of interactive systems to support individual dance learning, this paper argues that group dance settings are fertile ground for augmentation by interactive aids. To better understand these design opportunities, this paper presents a sequence of user-centered studies of and with amateur cheerleading troupes, spanning from the formative (interviews, observations) through the generative (an ideation workshop) to concept validation (technology probes and speed dating). The outcomes are a nuanced understanding of the lived practice of group dance learning, a set of interactive concepts to support those practices, and design directions derived from validating the proposed concepts. Through this empirical work, we expand the design space of interactive dance practice systems from the established context of single-user practice (primarily focused on gesture recognition) to a multi-user, group-based scenario focused on feedback and communication.
