Group decision-making processes frequently suffer when social influence and power dynamics suppress minority viewpoints, leading to compliance and groupthink. Conversational agents can counteract these harmful dynamics by encouraging critical thinking. This study investigates how LLM-powered devil’s advocate systems affect psychological safety, opinion expression, and satisfaction in power-imbalanced group dynamics. We conducted an experiment with 48 participants in 12 four-person groups, each containing three high-power (senior) and one low-power (junior) member. Each group completed decision tasks in both baseline and AI intervention conditions. Results show AI counterarguments fostered a more flexible atmosphere and significantly enhanced both process and outcome satisfaction for all participants, with particularly notable improvements for minority members. Cognitive workload increased slightly, though not significantly. This research contributes empirical evidence on how AI systems can effectively navigate power hierarchies to foster more inclusive decision-making environments, highlighting the importance of balancing intervention frequency, maintaining conversational flow, and preserving group cohesion.
