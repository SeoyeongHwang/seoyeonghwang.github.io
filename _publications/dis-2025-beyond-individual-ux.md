Recent advancements in HCI and AI have predominantly centered on individual user experiences, often neglecting the emergent dynamics of group interactions. This provocation introduces Group Experience(GX) to capture the collective perceptual, emotional, and cognitive dimensions that arise when individuals interact in cohesive groups. We challenge the conventional Human-centered AI paradigm and propose Group-centered AI(GCAI) as a framework that actively mediates group dynamics, amplifies diverse voices, and fosters ethical collective decision-making. Drawing on social psychology, organizational behavior, and group dynamics, we outline a group-centered design approach that balances individual autonomy with collective interests while developing novel evaluative metrics. Our analysis emphasizes rethinking traditional methodologies that focus solely on individual outcomes and advocates for innovative strategies to capture group collaboration. We call on researchers to bridge the gap between micro-level experiences and macro-level impacts, ultimately enriching and transforming collaborative human interactions.
